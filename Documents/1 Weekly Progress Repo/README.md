|---------|-------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Week 1| 16.01.2024 | Conducted a thorough literature survey, studied research papers concerning implemented methodologies such as various Hashing Techniques, Neural Networks etc. | Presented our findings to the mentors on 16.01.2024                                                                                                          |
| 2       | Week 2| 23.01.2024 | Explored options for implementation. Explored Hashing Techniques thoroughly. (p-hash, d-hash, w-hash, b-hash)                          | -                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3       | Week 3| 30.01.2024 | Conducted extensive dataset search; initiated communication with NUS professors for dataset acquisition.                                  | Dataset - California-ND                                                                                                                                     |
| 4       | Week 4| 06.02.2024 | Analyzed acquired dataset and successfully applied p-hash technique. Uploaded the script on GitHub.                                     | In p-hash it takes around 35 seconds for completion, however we do find the duplicates in the dataset. Thus, not that efficient.                           |
| 5       | Week 5| 13.02.2024 | Implemented d-hash technique. Uploaded the script on GitHub.                                                                          | We found out that d-hash was only working well for the exact duplicates.                                                                                     |
| 6       | Week 6| 20.02.2024 | Implemented CLIP: Connecting text and images model by OpenAI. Uploaded the script on GitHub.                                          | CLIP model takes approximately 3 minutes to run however it efficiently removes the near-duplicates and duplicate images.                                    |
| 7       | Week 7| 27.02.2024 | Refining accuracy for our implementations. Tried to look for more methods. Awaiting Approval from mentors regarding the script. Working on ways to improve time complexity. | -                                                                                                                                                            |
| 8       | Week 8| 05.03.2024 | Worked on the SIFT algorithm and implemented it in our own dataset. Didnâ€™t work well initially, but after a few optimizations, it works but also removes a few non-duplicate images. Still working on ways to optimize it even further. | -                                                                                                                                                            |
| 9       | Week 9| 12.03.2024 | Started writing the Research Paper writing. Uploaded SIFT implementation after refining to GitHub. After a thorough team discussion, we decided that we require a larger dataset to more thoroughly test our implementations. | -                                                                                                                                                            |
| 10      | Week 10| 19.03.2024| Fine tune the SIFT implementation. Works great on smaller dataset. Working on refining the method.                                      | -                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11      | Week 11| 26.03.2024| Finding a larger dataset to test the accuracy of the CLIP model. Restructuring the github repo. Currently the dataset we have contains 704 images. Finding a larger dataset to test the accuracy of the CLIP model. | -                                                                                                                                                            |
